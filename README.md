Let me introduce you imgur-folders, this small project uses modern browsers technology to store your images. It doesn't send or gather any information about you, your browser data or imgur account, the source code is available so you can check out.

How to use it:

Open the forward link and copy its content: https://pastebin.com/km19Pgnj

Open your browser console (chrome hit F12 or ctrl+shit+i) paste it script and hit enter.Tip: you can use up arrow key to repeat last command.

After loaded a plus tag is placed beside every image in a post and a box called "folders" should appear.

Hit a plus to expand the tag.
Click the button add to add image to root folder.

Write the name of the folder you want to put the image on in the tag input text.

Click a name of a folder to open it.
Click in the two dots to go to root folder.
So far there is no support to sub folders.
Click a image to copy the image URL.

If you navigate using this tab there is no need to reload imgur-folders, as long as the folders box appears on screen you'll only need to hit Q to place plus tags on all images of a post.

Considerations:
The add button at the bottom of folders box isn't working.
I've been developing for sometime now and I don't think it is useful because it need to be reloaded often, so I'm thinking about write a chrome app to use as a totally new user interface with all features we want.

If you change PC or Browser your folders won't be there, if you clear your browser data you'll wipe your folders. (3/3)

Your folders are stored in your browser nothing is sent to imgur servers or any server at all.(2/3)

It's a script, I thought maybe turn it into a Chrome extension but keeping as script any modern browser could use. (1/3)
